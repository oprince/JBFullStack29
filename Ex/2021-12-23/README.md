- Use a loop that will calculate the bar coordinates, direction (vertical or horizontal) and color. 
- The color options should be represented in an array.
- Represent the bar to be painted using an object.
- Pass the bar object to `drawBar()` function
- Add input field were number of bars should be entered by the user.


**Advanced:** Add “rotate colored bars” button that will draw a 45° rotated version of the above image

- Clean prior drawing before drawing shapes for a new mouse point
- All shapes should be drawn from the mouse click point
- Circle radius should be 20
- Circles should be painted in red
- Half circle painted in green. The starting point is the same. **Radius value is a random number between 30 and 100.**
- **Advanced**: Set random color value for the drawings
