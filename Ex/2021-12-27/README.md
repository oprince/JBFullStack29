## Ex 1: Practice queue and stack using arrays

- Use the [sample](canvas_draw_shapes.html) we built in class
- Change the array order so biggest is last, smallest is first
- Paint by using the stack and queue approaches.

## Ex 2: Complete the Bootstrap sample

- Use the [sample](bootstrap_cards_grid.html) we built in class
- Add `h5`, `p`, `href` elements to the card. You can use constant text
- Add new row and 3 columns if all grid columns are filled with a card
- Test your solution !!!!
