## Ex 1: Views

- Create classes for Locations and About views
- Use the new classes to display the class name in an HTML h1 element

## Ex 2: Ajax queries

Update the locations view:
- Run Ajax query to retreive cities.json from the WebServer
- Filter only cities with `"country": "IL"`. You may use [jsonpath](https://www.w3resource.com/JSON/JSONPath-with-JavaScript.php), or any other search algorithm.
- Build a select elements for the cities you have selected
- Use the selected city for the openweather query at Home view
