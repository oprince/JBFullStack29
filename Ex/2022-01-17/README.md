## Ex 1: translate JavaScript to TypeScript

- Create the file `draw_shapes.ts` in `ts` subfolder
- Traslate `draw_shapes_orig.js` to TypeScript in file `draw_shapes.ts`
  - Make sure that class member variable types are declared correctly
  - What should be the `canvas` and `ctx` members type ? How can you check that ?
  - Pay attention to editor alerts
- Transcompile `draw_shapes.ts`
- Check that the generated `draw_shapes.js` works correctly
