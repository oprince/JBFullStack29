## Ex 1: Translate JavaScript to TypeScript

- Create the file `draw_shapes.ts` in `ts` subfolder
- Traslate `draw_shapes_orig.js` to TypeScript in file `draw_shapes.ts`
  - Make sure that class member variable types are declared correctly
  - What should be the `canvas` and `ctx` members type ? 
  - Pay attention to editor alerts
- Transcompile `draw_shapes.ts` with `target`= `es6`
- Check that the generated `draw_shapes.js` works correctly
- Compare the file generated by transcompiler - `draw_shapes.js` with `draw_shapes_orig.js`
- Transcompile `draw_shapes.ts` with `target`= `es5`
- Compare the file generated by transcompiler - `draw_shapes.js` with `draw_shapes_orig.js`
