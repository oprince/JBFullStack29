## Ex 1: Linked list

- Use the [code](bootstrap_cards_grid.html) we have reviewed in the class.
- Add **search** button and input box next to **add** button
- When user clicks search, your code should search for all students with the same name as entered in the input box.

## Ex 2: Binary search

- Create a sorted array of numbers
- Implement `binarySearch()` function for sorted numbers array
- Test your function with few samples

**Advanced:**
- Implement `strBinarySearch()` function for sorted strings array
- Use [standard JavaScript strings comparison](https://javascript.info/comparison#string-comparison): 
- Once your `strBinarySearch()` function is tested successfully, change the students list at [Ex 1](#ex-1-linked-list) to be an array of objects, sorted by email.
- Use the `strBinarySearch()` to find if email of new student already exists.
